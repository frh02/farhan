                                            <p>This internship gave me an opportunity to take a deep dive into Deep Learning models.Working under the supervision of Dr.J.S.Shieh I learned how to process raw EEG signals and covert them into suitable image format using MATLAB. The data was gathered from the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) for over 50 patients who underwent ENT surgery by the anesthesiology department.Once the data was in appropiate format Convolutional Neural Network models were used for a multiclass classification of the Depth of Anesthesia in patients according to their BIS value.Various Deep Learning Models like VGG16Net, AlexNet, InceptionResNet50, 5 layered , 8 layered and 10 layered deep CNN models were implemented. The best accuracy was obtained for the 10 layered deep convolutional layer as it was not pretrained on the ImageNet dataset.</p>

                                            <h3>Research Intern-ERNET India(Nov 2019-Apr 2020)</h3>
                                            <p>ERNET India is an autonomous governmental organisation which specialises in LowPan energy systems and IoT based implementation of smart agriculture in rural areas.Under the guidance of Dr. Paventhan and Mr. Keshavan and working with my team members Siddharth Singh and Aditya Bhatnagar , I shared the responsibility of deploying a mobile Air Quality Monitoring system. Our team had the opportunity to implement the entire system using Narrow-Band IoT which is a field that is widely unexplored. Nb-IoT provides a robust and faster communication by transmitting more data withing limited Bandwidth and reducing the power comsumption because of the long-term usage of the Nb-Iot device.These devices were later launched over automobiles to get dynamic air quality index and the data collected was used to device a machine learning model which helps predict the AQI using parameters like location, relative humidity, temperature, pressure and CO, CO2 levels. The best accuracy was obtained for Support Vector Machine Model and Random Forest Regression giving an accuracy of over 95%. </p>

                                            <h3>Technical Intern-Larsen and Toubro India(May 2018-Jul 2018)</h3>
                                            <p>Larsen and Toubro is a major conglamorate in construction,infrastructure and Information Techonology. Mr. Pavan Mishra helped me to understand the basics of IT starting from software to hardware aspect. Undertaking projects like mapping and distribution of network helped me undertand computer network and telecommunication. As a part of the project , I was able to device a security algorithm for GSM commuication. This architecture is a hybrid of A5/1 cipher block algorithm and A5/2 algorithm and provides better security as it increases the complexity of the algorithm and less prone to decypher. Using a secret key helps to increase the randomness of the data to be transmitted and a non-linear function like xor operation helps to clock the encrypted message. </p>
