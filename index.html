											<h3>How Ontario’s mobility is shaping up since reopening</h3>
											<p>As we all are taken aback by this pandemic, global communities have come together and there has been emphasis on public health strategies, like social distancing measures, to slow the rate of transmission.One such initiative was taken by Google where they use aggregated, anonymized data which shows how busy certain types of places are — helping identify when a local business tends to be the most crowded.
												This article highlights the trend in the influx and out flux of people in certain places. The local government of Ontario announced a phase based reopening system, and the data collected is specific to the activities since phase 1 reopening of public places in Ontario.The findings below helps us to get a general view about the community mobility in relation to the COVID-19 crisis.</p>

											<h3>Data Beyond Perception</h3>
											<p>The quote “Data is everywhere” can’t be more true.We tend to see only what is presented to us, but we often overlook what information might be hidden inside each data.This article provides information about how we can find links and correlation between various features of a given data. Sometimes very important information which is vital for our analysis is hidden as a combination of individual features. Let’s jump in to the task at hand and find out the power of statistics and python.</p>

											<h3>Model Order Selection for Neural Data</h3>
											<p>Machine Learning plays an essential role for scientists to understand the relation between certain brain activities associated with some natural phenomenon. Finding the key to the encoded brain activities using raw signals become critical and this is when machine learning comes into action. Neuroscientists often use Machine Learning , Deep Learning models for their analysis. But sometimes it becomes very difficult to choose the correct order for our model. Problems like under fitting and over fitting have been a persistent problem for Data Scientist and various solutions have been figured. Honestly there is not a particular approach to solve this ambiguity, it all depends on the model complexity and the characteristics of the bias-variance trade off. We can get an outlook on how to select the best model for a given data set using the experimentation and study described below.</p>

											<h3>Logistic Regression for Image Classification</h3>
											<p>You can probably figure out the image above — pretty easy, right! What if this task was assigned to a machine or your computer,will it still be an easy task.It’s not that simple for computers if you are wondering, as they do not the gift of vision and inbuilt human-like classification prowess. So it becomes one of the preliminary task to communicate with your machine which is obviously in the form of 1’s and 0’s , and if anyone has prior knowledge that an image can be represented in a form of binary digits which makes the communicating easier. With the recent advances in GPU capacity and convolutional neural network, computer vision has gained great acclaim. Computers now give us better accuracy than humans for images that are quite complex and have features that are not easily differentiable by naked eye, but then again computers have the prowess to figure out the details stringently. Let’s take a dive into the endless scope of machine learning by just exploring a sub-domain of its many application — classifying images.</p>

											<h3>k-Nearest Neighbors and the Curse of Dimensionality</h3>
											<p>There is always a trade off between things in life. If you take up a certain path then there is always a possibility that you might have to compromise with some other parameter. Machine Learning models are no different, considering the case of k-Nearest Neighbor there has always been a problem which has a huge impact over classifiers that rely on pairwise distance and that problem is nothing but the “Curse of Dimensionality”. By the end of this article you will be able to create your own k-Nearest Neighbor Model and observe the impact of increasing the dimension to fit a data set. Let’s dig in!</p>

											<h3>COMPAS Case Study: Fairness of a Machine Learning Model</h3>
											<p>Recent events around the world raise many questions — is the society we are living in biased to a particular sect. With many unanswered questions about the racial discrimination, lets explore a case study about COMPAS which is tool used in many jurisdictions around the U.S. to predict if a convicted criminal is likely to re-offend. Machine learning algorithms are surely quite beneficial when it comes to predict a set of unknown depending upon the already acquired knowledge about the what we already know. Having said that for machine learning models to provide accuracy without bias it is imperative that the data on which the algorithm works upon is clean and without any pre-defined inclination towards a particular data. Sometimes machine learning models are just not suitable to be used on the grounds of social ethics and norms.</p>
