                                            <h3>Enhancement of A5/1 Stream Cipher with Non-Linear Function using MOSFET</h3>
                                            <p>Living in this modern era – the epitome of communication GSM networks is one of the mainly used architectures. But GSM architecture has its own shortcomings;the GSM network is vulnerable to various security threats. For any network to provide security to the user, the algorithms should be planned and designed in such a way that it provides cellular secrecy, data and signaling confidentiality to the concerned user. Keeping in mind the above features, the A5/1 algorithm provide network security. Initially, the A5/1 algorithm dealt with a pre-defined secret key but they still possess the threat of being decrypted by cryptanalytic attacks. Although decrypting this algorithm is not easy and requires high computational power.Such attacks lead to the necessity to modify the A5/1 algorithm; in our paper, we have proposed a better method to enhance the already existing algorithm</p>

                                            <h3>Soft Computing Methods for Fault Detection in Power Transmission Lines</h3>
                                            <p>Communication is a major aspect of our day to day life and for maintaining the transmission of the data; electric power transmission lines play a major role in acting as the medium for this transmission. The transmission lines can further be differentiated as an overhead transmission line and underground transmission line. But the transmission is often hindered by the physical factors or generally known as faults. In the past few years, the implementation of the underground cable
                                                has seen an upsurge as these cables are not easily affected by the
                                                physical factors as the overhead cables are, as a result, there have
                                                been various methods adopted by the engineers for the analysis,
                                                detection and control of these faulty lines. Depending on the
                                                supply range of a particular nation different materials are used
                                                for the transmission lines. Different fault detection methods are
                                                used for the exact location of the fault and implementing that in a
                                                digitized way is the optimum solution. Whenever there is a fault
                                                the entire transmission line is affected, to ensure that the safety of
                                                the transmission line a governing system has been implied in our
                                                proposed work. Locating a fault requires various detection
                                                methods, one such method is the time domain reflectometry
                                                (TDR) which we have inculcated in our analysis of fault lines.
                                                This technique incorporates the transmission of a pulse down the
                                                cable, any change in the characteristics impedance will cause a
                                                part of the incident pulse to reflect back, this knowledge is helpful
                                                for locating discontinuities in a system. </p>

                                            <h3>Depth of Anesthesia Prediction using Convolutional Neural Network and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition</h3>
                                            <p>According to a survey conducted recently the mortality rate due to anesthesia overdose in the case of
                                                surgical complication is close to 47%. This data shows us that there is a need to moderate the level of
                                                anesthesia. Recently deep learning (DL) methods have played a major role is estimating the depth of
                                                Anesthesia (DoA) of patients and has played an essential role to control the anesthesia overdose. In this
                                                paper we have used Electroencephalography (EEG) signals for the prediction of DoA. EEG signals are
                                                very complex signals which may require months of training and advanced signal processing features.
                                                It’s a point of debate whether DL methods are an improvement over the already existing traditional
                                                EEG processing approaches. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is very popular for object
                                                recognition and is widely growing its application in processing hierarchy in human visual system. In
                                                this paper we have used various decomposition methods for extracting the required EEG signal
                                                frequency. After acquiring the necessary signals values in image format we have deployed several CNN
                                                model for classification of DoA depending upon their Bispectral Index (BIS) and the signal quality
                                                indicator (SQI). The EEG signals were converted into the frequency domain using Ensemble Empirical
                                                mode decomposition (EEMD) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD).However, because of the
                                                inter mode mixing observed in EMD method, we have implemented EEMD for our study. The CNN
                                                models were then used for prediction using the EEG spectrum images without the use of handcrafted
                                                features which provides intuitive mapping with high efficiency and reliability. The best trained model
                                                gives an accuracy of 83.2%. So, this provides further scope and research which can be carried out in
                                                the domain of visual mapping of DoA using EEG signals and deep learning methods.</p>
